            "description":"If you want a full-suspension bike and aren’t ready to jump for something in the $2,500 range, Marin’s 120-millimeter-travel, 27.5-wheeled Hawk Hill is probably the way to go. It doesn’t come stock with a dropper post, but does feature just about every other indicator of a modern trail bike. Marin is a trustworthy brand, and the Hawk Hill has a pretty trustworthy spec, including a 10-speed drivetrain with a clutch-equipped Shimano Deore rear derailleur that shifts the chain on a SunRace 11-42 cassette. One-by doesn’t get more budget than that. Suspension is provided by a RockShox Recon Silver RL  fork and an X-Fusion O2 Pro R shock, and Schwalbe Hans Dampf tires provide some added cushion.."

            "description":"The Precept also sports modern, aggressive geometry-a size large has a roomy 460 millimeter reach, a 66.5 head angle and tight 425 millimeter chainstays. Given this bike’s aggressive stance, we’d say that the component most in need of upgrading will be the Shimano Acera brakes."
