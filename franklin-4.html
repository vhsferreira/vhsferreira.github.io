                <h2>Cold Continues in Nation's Northern Tier</h2>
                <p>Colder-than-average temperatures have returned to the nation's northern tier, and they will likely persist through next week.The core of the below-average temperatures will grip the north-central states Monday through Friday. That said, periods of chilly temperatures will also affect the South and Northeast, particularly late in the week.Highs in the teens and 20s will be common from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes next week. Subzero low temperatures will grip the northern Plains and upper Midwest while teens and single digits are likely in the rest of the Midwest and Great Lakes.</p>
